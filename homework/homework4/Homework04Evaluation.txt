Nice work on this assignment!

Here are a couple of observations and comments:

Your OddEven sort works fine.  I like the way you stated what's happening in
   the program with the original list, the sorted list, and the even-odd
   sorted list.  One thing to keep in mind for future programs, it would be
   even more helpful to the user to output something like:

     original list: [34, 2, 10, -9]
   expected output: [ -9 ] [ 2 ] [ 10 ] [ 34 ]
     actual output: [ -9 ] [ 2 ] [ 10 ] [ 34 ]

   that way the user knows exactly what is going on!

In the Simon game, it works properly, except you don't erase the simon
   string before asking the user for her entry.  Otherwise, good job!

Looks like Huffman is good, with the exception that you were supposed to
   ask the user for an input string.  However, the program works, giving a
   bit stream for the encoded message, and then decoding the message using
   the bit stream to re-create the message.

Very good work!
